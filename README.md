# Dialogue Wheel

## Project Description

This project implements a customizable dialogue wheel component for web applications and games. Built as a web component, it provides a circular interface for selecting conversation options during character interactions, making dialogue choices more intuitive and visually appealing.

## What is a Dialogue Wheel?

A dialogue wheel (or conversation wheel) is a user interface element that presents dialogue options to players in a circular format. Originally popularized by games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age, dialogue wheels have become a staple in modern RPGs and interactive narrative experiences.

Dialogue wheels offer several advantages over traditional list-based dialogue systems:

- **Spatial organization**: Options are arranged in a circle, grouping similar response types in consistent positions
- **Intuitive navigation**: Players can quickly identify and select their desired tone or approach
- **Visual clarity**: Color coding and positioning help convey the intent behind dialogue choices
- **Immersion**: Less intrusive than text lists, maintaining the flow of conversation

## Common Use Cases

Dialogue wheels are primarily used in:

- **Role-playing games**: For player-NPC interactions with emotional or tonal choices
- **Interactive storytelling applications**: To offer readers/users multiple ways to progress through narrative
- **Visual novels**: For character interaction and branching storylines
- **Training simulators**: In scenarios requiring various conversational approaches
- **Educational software**: For dialogue-based learning experiences

## Features of This Implementation

- **Web component-based**: Easy to integrate into any web project
- **Customizable appearance**: Adjust colors, size, segments, and visual styling
- **Responsive design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
- **Keyboard and mouse/touch controls**: Multiple input methods supported
- **Integration with dat.GUI**: Easy parameter adjustment through the interface
- **Event-based API**: Simple to connect with your application logic
